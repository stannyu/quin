#### Description for reviewers

*First thing to mention is that I hope it is not a test for creating documentation. 
This is just an assignment explanation*. 

I received this assignment at 17:51 but started at 6:40 due to video call on my current job.
It is 9:20 right now so I spend around 2,5 h for this task.
But this should not affect your judgement.

First thing I did - I read the assignment task carefully and created boilerplate project. (this took 20 - 30 minutes)

Then I setup Redux (actions, constants, selectors, reducers) and react router (another 20 minutes).

Using [awesome react](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) I first installed blue-print UI library because this one have date range picker 
and I knew that. But unfortunately this one wasn't compatible with yarn (or maybe CRA) and I had to install another one - ant design.
But I lost around 20 minutes trying to fix blueprint and then 20 minutes on setup for ant-design. At the end I had current date selected and 3 months 
from now as well with moment js help.

Then I setup axios for HTTP requests and redux-thunk for async actions. I am not familiar with launchlibrary API so it took
some time to figure how to get launches according to provided dates.
